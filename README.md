A conference (or a convention) in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. In todayâ€™s world, when conferences are beginning to shape the thoughts and ideals of people, we need conference management systems to help the managers successfully host a conference.

Our project is a conference management software, offering a Web-based solution for the management of events, abstract submissions, review process, and to therefore have an overview on all the upcoming conferences. It seamlessly integrates project management and task management, and helps to diplay it in an organised way. In addition to a powerful web application, it also supports mobile-version.

Our project is designed to help conference organisers to cope with the complexity of the refereeing process. 

It also allows conference and event managers to submit Abstracts which further makes handling the upcoming conferences a lot easier. Users can later on view abstracts and even and even edit them to their own liking. Therefore, we support file uploads (extended abstracts, camera-ready version) and handling of deadlines, size limitations, format restrictions.

With an extremely user friendly UI that makes it easy to use and work on we also support a mobile-version of our website in which users can handle their accounts once the have successfully logged in.

Our Web Management System is a feature-rich conference management sofware that tries to accommodate the support needs of a range of very different conference configurations. In order to be flexible enough to be deployed efficiently in different scenarios, almost all features are optional.
